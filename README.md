**data**
O*NET data contains a rich set of variables that describe work and worker characteristics, link: [https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html?p=2]



**goal**

1. provide definition of analytical: to better understand analytical work 

-   Come up with approaches, evaluate these approaches, tradeoffs

-   Settle on an approach for defining jobs as analytica: defining which jobs as analytical.

-   Provide efinition of “analytical”


2. provide insights on whether there is a gender gap for analytical work in the labor force

1) categorize which jobs are analytical

2) combine datasets, compare gender ratio for analytical jobs and non-analytical jobs 

3) evaluate the gender gap, what other data sources can further work on



# **Deliverable**
1. replicatable script(s) 

2. A short slide deck with the following pieces of information. 

a.       A description of your approach. What approaches did you consider? What are the tradeoffs between different approaches you considered? Why did you settle on the approach you used?  

b.       A working definition of “analytical,” and an evaluation of that definition. What occupations come up as analytical? Are there surprises? What were your assumptions? How would you change your approach given more time?  

c.       Evaluation of the analytical gender gap. What questions does this answer? What questions does it raise? How would you present the findings to the client? Is the O*NET data appropriate for this task? What other sources of data could be included to make your work more accurate, and how would you adjust your approach given that new data?
